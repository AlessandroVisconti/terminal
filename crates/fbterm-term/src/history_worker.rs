//! The background worker that compresses terminals' cold history.
//!
//! With history compression on, a terminal's old history blocks are compressed by history jobs
//! (feathercritty's `Term::next_history_jobs`). A job holds a copy of its block, so the work runs
//! with no lock held; only taking jobs and installing results lock the terminal. One worker
//! thread, `fbterm-history-worker` at a lowered priority, serves every terminal in the process:
//! [`enqueue`] after a feed that leaves jobs, and it sleeps on a condition variable while no
//! terminal has any (it never ticks).
//!
//! Jobs go in batches of [`BATCH`]: one lock hold installs the previous batch's results and takes
//! the next, so the worker keeps up with a parser that holds the lock almost all the time (with
//! one job per hold, a sustained flood grew the backlog without bound). Terminals take turns,
//! one batch each per turn; a terminal's next batch, taken in the hold that installed the last,
//! waits in its queue entry for its next turn.
